This directory should contain shell scripts configuring system-wide
environment on users' shells.

Files with the .sh extension found in this directory are evaluated by
Bourne-compatible shells (like ash, bash or zsh) when started as a
login shell.

### ~/

never install binary into your user directory...

It's not security to do so.

Instead uses open.usr.local() and install the binary using your user shell pointing to /usr/local... and close.usr.local()

Both functions are declared into root's .ashrc.

Doing like this you will be safer with binary mutation/rewrite :)

Careful with internet... there is dumbasses looking smart...
