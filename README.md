## Facing problem(s)

- my environment vanish when I use "startx"...

## late feature(s)

- learn to install with user privileges and a separate gatekeeper "root"... most ppl uses sudo... me I don't...

- **NO ROUTE TO HOST**(inside the **DMZ**) The scenario attack becomes entirely **inside out** from the only allowed routes and physical access...

# updated kernel 6.12.1-3-lts

Here the result, Its obvious they **sabotaging** the feature for obscure reason(s) :D

```sh
ip route add default blackhole dev "$INTERFACE"
>> ip: either "to" is duplicate, or "dev" is garbage
```

just explain me why a fucking ip block from 4228250625 ip address just go through...

and just one IP doesn't... IT's CLEAR like water... only idiot doesn't understand what's happening here... :D

THEY LOVES GANGBANG in your devices and it's obvious from their behavior :D We have A nice discovery here... they watching me... :)

#### I love dumbasses :D

we need to modify their modifications to be free as in freedom... damn it I can't belive I spotted them so easily. :DDDDD

# this feature is in pause for sabotage by the kernel team! YEAH!!! :D

an attacker is far to be able to route back host to the wan without performing zig zag in some known place.

Do we need a 600pages book to learn about that?? absolutly not. 4 lines we good. Where is my PhD? :D

- some periodic goodies... some ppl call them workflow... it's tasky without the hands :D
