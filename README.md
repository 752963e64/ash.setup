Enhance your bb ash experience.

## late feature(s)

- learn to install with user privileges and a separate gatekeeper "root"... most ppl uses sudo... me I don't...

- **NO ROUTE TO HOST**(inside the **DMZ**) The scenario attack becomes entirely **inside out** from the only allowed routes and physical access...

an attacker is far to be able to route back host to the wan without performing zig zag in some known place.

Do we need a 600pages book to learn about that?? absolutly not. 4 lines we good. Where is my PhD? :D

- some periodic goodies... some ppl call them workflow... it's tasky without the hands :D
